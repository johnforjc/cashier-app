# SImple Cashier Application With ReactJS

This project just a mock up from cashier web based application. I am using ReactJS for the front end. The product are static that you can found the list of product on [product.js](https://github.com/johnforjc/cashier-app/blob/master/src/data/product.js) file.

## What this application do?

This application can calculating the product that listed on cashier, and also can print the listed product too. Unfortunately, my application is only a mockup with static website so cannot stored on database the transaction has done with this application. Another note for this application is single page application(SPA).
